# Dataset Information and Intent of this Project
This dataset contains 1 million data points to predict salary, given factors such as company, education, field, years of experience, etc. 
It is a 'clean' dataset in that there are no missing or null data points to deal with, nor are there any numerical or categorical values that _have_ to be transformed. For this reason, I'm using this project as an opportunity to refamiliarize myself with the Python syntax as well as the pandas, numpy and matplotlib libraries in particular.
